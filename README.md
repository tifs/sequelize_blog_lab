#Blog Lab

In this lab we will be making a simple blog platform. In many ways this app will be similar to the Daily Planet app. Feel free to modify it if you wish.

##Objective
* User should be able to go to a form, and fill out a blog post containing `post` and `author`
* When storing the `post` use a `1 to many relationship` between author and blog post.
* Have a main route `/blog` that will contain all blog posts sorted by date
* Have a route to only display the blog post by 1 user. User a url like `/user/5`

##How to get started
1. `npm init` your project folder. And create the necessary folders for your project.
2. Start coding your `models` file. This will include setting up `Sequelize` dependencies.
3. Create the model `Author` and relationship `Posts` that will be talking to each other.


##Bonus
* Feel free to add `edit` and `delete` functionality.
